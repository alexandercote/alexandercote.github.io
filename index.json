[{"categories":null,"contents":"Modified a Delta-Q “QuiQ 1500” battery charger to become a lab power supply. Identified locations in the control loop to override the feedback to allow for a controlled voltage and current output. Designed a circuit and implemented it using proto-board to avoid control loop saturation and initial overshoot.\n","permalink":"https://alexandercote.github.io/projects/creations/1-deltaq-battery-charger/","tags":["Power Electronics","Electronics"],"title":"1500W Battery Charger to Power Supply Modification"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Worked in a team of 3 to implement a music playing alarm clock using a shield on an STM32F4 microcontroller board. Features included displaying time on a 7 segment display, alarm buttons, snooze, ability to change time and volume control. Gained practice with schematic capture, circuit design and simulation (using resistors, diodes, transistors and Op-Amps), circuit prototyping on breadboards, PCB layout and routing, basic SolidWorks design for a case and writing software for a simple real time system.\n","permalink":"https://alexandercote.github.io/projects/creations/4-alarm-clock-and-audio-amplifer-/","tags":["KiCAD","Board Design","Amplifiers","SolidWorks","3D Modelling"],"title":"Alarm Clock and Audio Amplifier"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://alexandercote.github.io/projects/creations/2-light-pid-controller/","tags":["Control Systems"],"title":"Light Controlled LED - PID Controller"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...

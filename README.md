# alexandercote.github.io
Personal website used to host projects.
Check it out [here](https://alexandercote.github.io/).

Used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo's Homepage") to generate my personal website. The template used for the website is called [Resume](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-resume/).

This website both acted as a useful tool to show off projects, as well as get some basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

Modifications to the template include:
 - Changing colours
 - Adding new sections not created in the template
 - Modifying json and html file structures to better fit data structure and layout
